# Editor's Notes

Personal opinions and editorial reasoning from the project owner. These provide context for anticipating editorial direction — the *why* behind choices, not the rules themselves (which live in the style guide).

## On Terminology

### "AI" vs "LLM" vs "Frontier Model"
- **"AI"**: Historically cringed at this term being applied to early LLMs, but it has become the common lay-term. Modern LLMs are finally approaching something worthy of the title. Accept it as the accessible term.
- **"LLM"**: Technical jargon. Spell out "Large Language Model" on first use; don't assume familiarity.
- **"Frontier model"**: Dislike this term. Carries marketing connotations of leading providers positioning their models as preferred bases for fine-tuned derivatives (e.g., via AWS Bedrock). Avoid unless discussing that specific context.

## On AI-Slop (The Reasoning)

The style guide lists specific phrases to avoid. Here's *why* this matters:

Contemporary readers have been exposed to years of low-quality LLM-generated content. Certain tones now trigger an immediate "tuning out" — a visceral sense of insubstantiality. This isn't just aesthetic preference; it's a real barrier to engagement.

The dangerous patterns aren't obviously bad. They're the *default modes* LLMs fall into when not carefully prompted: faux-enthusiastic conversation, over-confident minimalism, generic explanation that's neither technical-enough nor engaging-enough. Content that reads like it could have been written by any LLM about any topic.

## On Visual Design

General principle: **restraint over variation**. Each visual element adds cognitive load. The modern trend of mixing 3+ typefaces without clear visual blocking feels chaotic (e.g., Starbucks' 2025 menu redesign). Variation should be purposeful, not decorative.

## On the Project's Purpose

This explainer exists because:
1. AI is becoming ubiquitous but poorly understood
2. Existing explanations are either too technical (papers, Wikipedia) or too shallow (marketing, pop articles)
3. There's value in a middle path: substantive but accessible, curious but not condescending

The goal is not to make everyone an ML engineer. It's to give thoughtful people a mental model for understanding what these systems are and what that means for using them.
