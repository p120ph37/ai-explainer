**Why does the same prompt sometimes give different answers?**

When a model generates text, it doesn't just pick the most likely next token. It samples from a probability distribution. This controlled randomness produces variety.

**Temperature** is the dial that controls this randomness. Low temperature makes the distribution sharper, concentrating probability on likely tokens. High temperature flattens the distribution, giving unlikely tokens more chance.

<Metaphor title="A volume dial on creativity">

Temperature is like a volume dial where loud is chaos and quiet is conformity.

Turn it down, and the model whispers conventional answers. It sticks close to the obvious, the safe, the well-trodden path. Safe, but predictable. Like a musician who only plays the exact notes on the page.

Turn it up, and the model shouts unexpected connections, grabbing words from the margins. Exciting, but potentially nonsense. Like a jazz improviser who might transcend the melody or miss the chord entirely.

Most conversations want moderate volume: enough variety to stay interesting, enough restraint to stay coherent.

</Metaphor>

**How temperature works**

The model outputs raw scores (logits) for each possible next token. Before sampling, these scores are divided by the temperature value, then converted to probabilities.

- **Temperature = 0**: Always pick the highest probability token. Completely deterministic.
- **Temperature = 0.7**: Moderate randomness. Usually sensible with some variety.
- **Temperature = 1.0**: Standard randomness. Probabilities used as-is.
- **Temperature = 2.0**: High randomness. Less likely tokens get much more chance.

Lower temperature means safer, more predictable text. Higher temperature means riskier, more surprising text.

<Recognition title="The regenerate button">

If you've regenerated a response and gotten something different (sometimes better, sometimes worse, sometimes surprisingly different) that's temperature and sampling in action.

Users who've used AI for both code and creative writing often develop different intuitions: "When I want code, I want it predictable. When I want stories, I want surprise." This is naturally discovering when different temperature settings are appropriate.

</Recognition>

<Question title="If temperature=0 always picks the most likely token, why not use that for everything?">

Most likely isn't always best. At temperature=0, the model can get stuck in repetitive patterns. The same phrase keeps being the most probable continuation of itself. Output becomes mechanical and predictable.

Some tasks need exploration of alternatives. When multiple good options exist, always picking one ignores equally valid paths. Temperature adds necessary variety.

<Question title="Doesn't randomness hurt accuracy?">

At low temperatures, not significantly. The model strongly favors high-probability tokens, which correlate with quality. At higher temperatures, yes: you trade accuracy for creativity.

For factual tasks, use low temperature. For brainstorming, higher temperature. The control is precise: you're adjusting how much the model explores vs. exploits its best guess.

</Question>

**When to use different temperatures**

**Low temperature (0-0.3)**:
- Factual questions
- Code generation
- Data extraction
- Anything where there's a "right" answer

**Medium temperature (0.5-0.8)**:
- General conversation
- Explanations
- Problem-solving
- Most everyday use

**High temperature (1.0+)**:
- Creative writing
- Brainstorming
- Exploring alternatives
- When you want surprises

<Question title="What about top-p and top-k?">

Temperature isn't the only sampling parameter.

**Top-k**: Only consider the k most likely tokens. If k=50, tokens ranked 51+ are eliminated before sampling.

**Top-p (nucleus sampling)**: Only consider tokens whose cumulative probability reaches p. If p=0.9, keep adding tokens by probability until their total reaches 90%.

These can combine with temperature. A common setup: temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9. This provides variety while preventing very unlikely tokens.

Top-p is generally more adaptive than top-k. In situations with one clear best choice, it might select only a few options; when many are plausible, it includes more.

</Question>

<Question title="At temperature=2.0, would the model produce gibberish?">

Often, yes. Very high temperatures flatten probability distributions so much that improbable tokens become too likely. You get grammatically broken text, nonsense words, bizarre tangents.

Most practitioners stay in the 0.5-1.0 range for usable output. Temperature above 1.5 is experimental.

</Question>

**The determinism question**

With temperature=0, is output fully deterministic? Mostly, but not always.

Sources of non-determinism:
- GPU floating-point operations can vary slightly
- Batch composition might affect results
- API providers may use sampling internally even at temperature=0
- Model updates can change behavior

If you need reproducibility, some APIs offer seed parameters. Even then, exact reproduction isn't guaranteed across different hardware or model versions.

<Expandable title="The sampling process in detail">

Full generation with sampling:

1. Model outputs logits (raw scores) for all vocabulary tokens
2. Divide logits by temperature
3. Apply softmax to convert to probabilities
4. Apply top-k filtering (keep only top k tokens)
5. Apply top-p filtering (keep tokens until cumulative prob reaches p)
6. Renormalize remaining probabilities
7. Sample one token from this distribution
8. Repeat for next token

Each step shapes the distribution. Temperature first, then filtering, then sampling. The final token could be any of the survivors, weighted by probability.

**Temperature and quality**

Higher temperature doesn't mean better or worse. It means different.

Too low: repetitive, boring, gets stuck in loops
Too high: incoherent, random, loses the thread

The sweet spot depends on the task. There's no universally optimal temperature. Experimentation reveals what works for your specific use case.

<TryThis>

Ask the same creative prompt three times at temperature 0.2, then three times at 0.9. Notice the variation. Low temperature gives near-identical responses. High temperature gives different responses each time, sometimes wildly different. Feel the trade-off directly.

If you've ever experienced AI getting stuck in repetitive loops, that's often low-temperature determinism in action. Regenerating (re-sampling) breaks loops.

**Temperature is a symptom**

The need for temperature reveals something about how LLMs work. They don't compute "the answer." They compute a probability distribution over possible answers. Sampling from that distribution is where the specific response emerges.

This is fundamentally different from a calculator or search engine, which return definite results. The LLM always sees multiple possibilities. Temperature determines how it navigates them.
