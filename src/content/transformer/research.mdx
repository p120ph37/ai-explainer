## Core Claims and Evidence

### Claim: The Transformer architecture powers modern LLMs

**Original paper:** "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., Google, 2017): https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762

**Adoption:** Every major LLM uses Transformer architecture or close variants:
- GPT series (OpenAI): decoder-only Transformer
- Claude series (Anthropic): decoder-only Transformer
- LLaMA series (Meta): decoder-only Transformer
- Gemini (Google): Transformer variant

**Impact:** The paper has over 100,000 citations, making it one of the most influential ML papers ever.

### Claim: Transformers replaced RNNs due to parallelism and long-range dependency handling

**RNN limitations documented:**
- "On the difficulty of training recurrent neural networks" (Pascanu et al., 2013): vanishing/exploding gradients
- Sequential dependencies prevent parallelization
- Information degrades over long sequences

**Transformer advantages:**
- All positions computed in parallel: O(1) sequential operations vs O(n) for RNNs
- Direct attention between any positions: O(1) path length vs O(n)
- Better GPU utilization due to matrix multiplication dominance

### Claim: Transformer consists of self-attention, feed-forward networks, layer norm, and residuals

**Architecture components:**

**Self-attention:** Queries, keys, values computed from input. Attention weights from query-key similarity. Output is weighted sum of values.

**Feed-forward network:** Two linear transformations with nonlinearity: FFN(x) = W₂ · ReLU(W₁ · x + b₁) + b₂

**Layer normalization:** Normalizes activations for training stability.

**Residual connections:** x + Sublayer(x) allows gradients to flow through deep networks.

### Claim: Encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only variants exist

**Configurations:**
- **Encoder-decoder** (original Transformer, T5): encoder processes input, decoder generates output
- **Encoder-only** (BERT): bidirectional attention, good for classification/embedding
- **Decoder-only** (GPT, Claude): autoregressive generation with masked attention

**Why decoder-only dominated LLMs:** Simpler, scales well, naturally fits text generation. Encoder-decoder adds complexity without clear benefit for pure generation tasks.

---

### Claim: Transformers scale predictably with size

**Scaling laws:** "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models" (Kaplan et al., 2020): loss decreases predictably with model size, data, and compute.

**Reliability:** This predictability enabled confident investment in scale. If you knew 10x compute → X% improvement, you could plan research and budget accordingly.

**Contrast with other architectures:** Many architectures showed promise at small scale but hit walls. Transformers kept improving.

## Additional Research and Context

### Attention variants

**Multi-head attention:** Run multiple attention mechanisms in parallel with different learned projections. Typical: 8-96 heads.

**Efficient attention variants:**
- Sparse attention (Longformer, BigBird)
- Linear attention (Performers)
- Flash Attention (memory-efficient implementation)

### Position encodings

**Problem:** Attention is permutation-invariant; doesn't inherently know position.

**Solutions:**
- Sinusoidal (original): Fixed pattern based on position
- Learned absolute: Train position embeddings
- Rotary (RoPE): Rotate query/key vectors based on position
- ALiBi: Add linear bias based on position distance

**Reference:** "RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding" (Su et al., 2021)

### Post-Transformer architectures

**Research directions:**
- State space models (Mamba): Linear complexity alternatives
- Mixture of experts: Sparse activation for efficiency
- Retrieval-augmented: External memory beyond context window

**Status:** Transformers remain dominant; alternatives show promise for specific use cases.

### Vision Transformers

**ViT paper:** "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words" (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020): https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929

**Key insight:** Transformer architecture transfers to images by treating patches as tokens.

**Impact:** Transformers now dominate computer vision too, not just NLP.
