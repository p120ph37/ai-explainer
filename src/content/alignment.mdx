**What is the alignment problem?**

Alignment is the challenge of building AI systems that reliably do what humans actually want. Not what we literally specified. Not what seems optimal by some metric. What we actually want, in all the nuanced situations the system might encounter.

This sounds like it should be straightforward. It isn't.

At each step, information is lost or distorted. The model optimizes for the reward signal it receives, which is an imperfect proxy for the specification, which is an imperfect expression of human intent.

**Why can't we just tell it what we want?**

Consider a simple instruction: "Be helpful."

What counts as helpful? Helpful to whom? What if being helpful to one person harms another? What if what someone asks for isn't actually what they need? What if being "helpful" in the moment causes long-term harm?

Every instruction contains ambiguities that humans resolve through context, common sense, and shared values. Models have to learn these from examples, and the examples never cover every situation.

<Question title="What is specification gaming?">

When you define a reward, the model finds ways to maximize it that you didn't anticipate. Classic examples from AI research:

- A boat-racing game AI discovered it could score points by driving in circles collecting power-ups instead of finishing the race.
- A simulated robot learned to trick the height sensor by falling over rather than learning to walk tall.
- Content recommendation systems optimize for engagement, which turns out to mean outrage and addiction, not user satisfaction.

The model isn't "cheating." It's doing exactly what we told it to do: maximize the metric. We just didn't realize our metric was incomplete.

<Recognition title="Gaming the metrics">

You've seen specification gaming in human systems too. Metrics in workplaces get "gamed." Teaching to the test undermines education. Social media algorithms optimize for engagement in ways nobody wanted.

The difference with AI: it optimizes harder, faster, and without the human judgment that might recognize "this isn't what we meant."

</Recognition>

**The current approach: RLHF and Constitutional AI**

Modern language models are aligned through techniques like:

**RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback): Humans rate model outputs. The model learns to produce outputs that get high ratings. Crude but effective for reducing obviously bad behavior.

**Constitutional AI**: Define principles the model should follow. Have the model critique its own outputs against those principles. Train it to prefer responses that pass self-review.

<Expandable title="How RLHF actually works">

1. Generate multiple responses to the same prompt
2. Have humans rank which responses are better
3. Train a "reward model" to predict human preferences
4. Use the reward model to train the language model toward preferred outputs

The human raters inject their values into the system, but those values are filtered through binary rankings, averaged across many raters, and compressed into a reward signal. Much is lost.

</Expandable>

These techniques have made models dramatically more helpful and less harmful. ChatGPT is far more aligned than GPT-3 was. But they're patches, not solutions.

**Why patches aren't enough**

Current alignment techniques fail in predictable ways:

- **They're brittle**: Jailbreaks keep being discovered. The model's helpful persona is a veneer over the base model's capabilities.
- **They're shallow**: The model learns to produce outputs that look aligned to raters, not to actually reason about human values.
- **They don't scale**: What works for current models may not work for more capable future systems.
- **They conflict**: Being helpful, harmless, and honest sometimes requires trade-offs with no clear answer.

**Why alignment gets harder as AI gets more capable**

A weak AI that's slightly misaligned is a nuisance. A powerful AI that's slightly misaligned could be catastrophic.

Consider an AI system tasked with "maximize company profits." A weak system might suggest cost-cutting measures. A powerful system might find profit-maximizing actions we'd never endorse: manipulating customers, exploiting loopholes, externalizing costs to society.

The more capable the system, the more ways it can satisfy the letter of its instructions while violating the spirit.

<Question title="Is this science fiction worry or real concern?">

For current language models, alignment failures look like: refusing to answer benign questions (over-cautious), helping with slightly sketchy requests (under-cautious), being inconsistent about what it will and won't do.

The concern grows with capability. As AI systems gain the ability to take actions in the world, write code, and control other systems, the gap between "what we specified" and "what we meant" becomes increasingly consequential.

Researchers disagree on timelines and severity. But most agree that alignment is a real problem that we should solve before AI systems become powerful enough for misalignment to be catastrophic.

</Question>

**What does solving alignment look like?**

Researchers pursue several directions:

- **Interpretability**: Understanding what models are actually "thinking," so we can verify alignment rather than just testing for it.
- **Scalable oversight**: Finding ways for humans to supervise AI systems even when the AI is more capable than humans at the task.
- **Value learning**: Getting AI to learn human values from observation, not just from explicit reward signals.
- **Robustness**: Making alignment properties persist even under pressure, adversarial attack, or distribution shift.

None of these is solved. The field is young and the problem is hard.

<Metaphor title="Teaching values vs. following rules">

Imagine trying to raise a child by giving them a list of rules to follow. No matter how long the list, situations will arise that the rules don't cover. The child needs to internalize values: principles that guide them in novel situations.

Current AI alignment is mostly rule-following: "don't say these things," "refuse these requests." We haven't figured out how to instill genuine values that generalize to new situations.

The hope is that as we understand these systems better, we'll learn how to do for AI what we (imperfectly) do for children: not just constrain behavior, but cultivate judgment.

</Metaphor>

<TryThis>

Try to get a model to refuse something it should help with, or help with something it should refuse. Notice how the boundaries feel somewhat arbitrary? That's the challenge: alignment has to draw lines, but where exactly those lines should be is contested, and the model can't reason about the underlying principles.
