# Cognitive Load Management

## Core Principle

Users may be encountering AI concepts entirely de novo. Every design decision should minimize unnecessary cognitive burden while maximizing learning.

## Content Chunking

- Break complex ideas into digestible pieces
- Each piece should be satisfying on its own (not cliffhangers)
- Leave just enough curiosity to encourage continued exploration
- Never overwhelm with too many new terms at once

## Navigation Clarity

- User should always know where they are in the concept hierarchy
- Clear visual indication of "depth" level
- Easy to go up (to context), down (to detail), or sideways (to related)
- Breadcrumbs or similar for path awareness

## Progressive Disclosure

- Default view shows high-level explanation
- Detail is hidden but accessible (expandable sections)
- Visual hierarchy: summary > explanation > deep dive
- Interactive elements enhance but aren't required

## The Satisfaction Balance

Each node must balance:
1. **Completeness**: User feels they learned something real
2. **Curiosity**: User wants to explore further
3. **Confidence**: User feels capable of understanding more

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Jargon without explanation
- Assuming background knowledge not established
- Dense technical paragraphs
- Too many hyperlinks competing for attention
- Required interaction to understand content
- Forward references ("as we'll see later" without context)
