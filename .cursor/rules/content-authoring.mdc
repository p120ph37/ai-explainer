# Content Authoring Rules

## The Optionally Opaque Rule

When mentioning a concept not yet explained in the prerequisite path:
- The surrounding text MUST make sense without understanding the new term
- New terms should be hyperlinked using `<Term id="concept-id">` component
- Avoid definitions that require understanding other undefined terms

**Good:** "The model uses *attention* (a way of focusing on relevant parts) to process your input."
**Bad:** "The model uses attention to compute weighted query-key dot products."

## Cognitive Load Limits

- Each content node's core explanation: 2-4 paragraphs max
- One main concept per node
- Use `<Expandable>` for deeper detail, not inline complexity
- If a paragraph requires more than 2 new terms, split it up

## Prerequisites

Every content node must declare its prerequisites in `meta.prerequisites`.
The content may ONLY use concepts explained in those prerequisite nodes.
Before using any technical term, verify it's defined in a prerequisite.

## Recognition Hooks Required

Every content node MUST include at least one of:
- `<Recognition>` block connecting to user's existing experience
- `<TryThis>` block with a concrete action they can take
- Real-world example from familiar AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

## Citations

Factual claims about AI capabilities, limitations, or architecture must be cited.
Use `<Citation>` component with appropriate `type`:
- `paper` for research papers (mark as technical)
- `video` for video explainers (mark as accessible)
- `docs` for official documentation
- `article` for blog posts and articles

## File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `what-is-llm.tsx` not `whatIsLlm.tsx`
- Name should match the node's `id` in the navigation graph
- Group related nodes in subdirectories by topic area
