# What are Parameters? — Metaphor Voice

*Single-threaded narrative deeply immersed in metaphorical thinking.*

---

A landscape of possibilities stretches beyond imagining.

Each parameter is a dimension. Two parameters form a plane. Three form a space. Billions form a hyperspace where every point represents a possible mind — a specific configuration of all parameters.

Most points are useless. The model outputs gibberish, random associations, no coherent language. But somewhere in this vast landscape exist rare valleys where the configuration works, where inputs transform into meaningful outputs.

Training is searching this landscape. Gradient descent is the compass pointing downhill toward lower error. Step by step, the random starting point migrates through hyperspace, seeking valleys where language makes sense.

**The distributed hologram**

Knowledge in a neural network is like a hologram stored on film.

In a hologram, the image isn't located at any specific point on the film. Every part of the film contains the whole image, diffusely. Cut the film in half, and each half still shows the complete image, just with less resolution.

Parameters work similarly. Paris being France's capital isn't stored in parameter 47,382,001. It's distributed across millions of parameters. Damage a few and the knowledge persists, degraded. The information is everywhere and nowhere.

**The symphony of weights**

175 billion parameters is an orchestra of 175 billion musicians.

No single musician plays the melody. The melody emerges from their collective interaction. Ask which musician plays "grammar" and the question makes no sense. Grammar emerges from the interplay of thousands of musicians, each contributing a tiny fraction.

The conductor (training) doesn't direct individual musicians. It shapes the overall sound by rewarding harmony and penalizing discord. Gradually, the orchestra learns to play coherent language from what began as random noise.

**The JPEG analogy**

Think of how JPEG compression works.

A photo isn't stored as "sky in the top half, grass in the bottom half." It's stored as mathematical coefficients that, when processed together, reconstruct the image. No single coefficient contains "sky." The information is distributed.

Parameters are similar coefficients. The "image" they reconstruct is the function that maps inputs to outputs. The model's knowledge is encoded in the mathematical relationships between parameters, not in any individual value.

**The capacity balloon**

More parameters inflate a capacity balloon.

A small balloon can only hold simple patterns — basic rules, common associations. A massive balloon can hold nuance — subtle distinctions, rare exceptions, complex interactions.

But an inflated balloon needs filling. Without sufficient training data, the balloon remains partly empty, or worse, fills with noise (memorization rather than generalization). The balloon must match the gas: parameter count must match data quantity.

**The precision tradeoff**

Each parameter can be encoded with more or less precision.

Full precision is a high-resolution photograph. Every subtle gradation preserved. But it takes more storage, more compute.

Quantization is compression. The photograph becomes slightly blurry, but takes a fraction of the space. Remarkably, billions of slightly blurry numbers still combine into sharp outputs. The redundancy across parameters absorbs the individual imprecision.

**The interpretability horizon**

The landscape is too large to map.

We can measure what the model does from outside. We can count the dimensions. But we cannot yet say "this region of the landscape encodes irony" or "that region handles causality." The encoding is too distributed, too high-dimensional for current tools.

The model knows things we cannot locate. It has learned patterns we cannot articulate. The interpretability horizon is the boundary of our understanding — we can see the model works, but not quite how.

Crossing that horizon is one of the great challenges. What would it mean to truly understand a billion-dimensional mind?
