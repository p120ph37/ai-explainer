# What is Emergent Behavior? — Primary Voice

**Why do capabilities suddenly appear at certain scales?**

You might expect AI capabilities to improve smoothly as models get bigger. Instead, some abilities are absent in smaller models, then suddenly present in larger ones. Like flipping a switch.

This is **emergence**: capabilities that arise from scale without being explicitly programmed. The model wasn't trained to do arithmetic. Yet at sufficient size, it can. Nobody taught it to translate between languages it rarely saw paired. Yet it does.

**Emergence beyond AI**

This phenomenon isn't unique to language models. It appears throughout nature:

- **Water**: Individual H₂O molecules don't have wetness. But enough molecules together are wet.
- **Flocking**: Each bird follows simple rules. The flock exhibits complex, coordinated patterns.
- **Consciousness**: Individual neurons aren't conscious. Somehow, enough together produce experience.
- **Cities**: No central planner designs traffic patterns. They emerge from individual decisions.

In each case, the whole has properties absent from the parts. Simple components, simple rules, complex outcomes.

**Emergent capabilities in LLMs**

Documented emergent capabilities include:

- **Multi-step arithmetic**: Small models can't add three-digit numbers. Large models can.
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning**: The ability to work through problems step by step.
- **Cross-lingual transfer**: Learning a skill in one language, applying it in another.
- **Theory of mind**: Modeling what other agents might believe or want.
- **Code execution tracing**: Mentally stepping through code to predict outputs.

These appear at different scale thresholds. Below the threshold: failure. Above it: success. The transition can be sharp.

**Is emergence real or a measurement artifact?**

This is debated. Some researchers argue emergent capabilities are artifacts of how we measure. If we used smoother metrics, we'd see gradual improvement instead of sudden jumps.

Others point to genuine phase transitions: qualitative changes in what the model can represent. Like water freezing, there may be critical points where system behavior fundamentally shifts.

What's undeniable is that *something* happens at scale that we didn't predict and can't easily explain. Whether we call it emergence or something else, it's surprising.

**Why does prediction create reasoning?**

This is the core mystery. The training objective is simple: predict the next token. How does this create capabilities like reasoning?

One hypothesis: to predict well across all human writing, you must model the processes that generate text. Humans reason, plan, know facts, feel emotions. Text reflects this. To predict such text, the model develops something like these capabilities.

The prediction task is simple. Achieving excellent prediction across all human expression is not simple. It requires modeling the complexity of human thought.

**Emergence and unpredictability**

Emergence is partly why AI capabilities are hard to forecast. We can predict loss improvements from scaling laws. We cannot easily predict *which capabilities* will emerge at which scales.

This makes frontier AI development partly exploratory. You build bigger models partly to discover what they can do. The capabilities weren't specified in advance; they're found empirically.

This is both exciting and concerning. Exciting because new capabilities await. Concerning because we can't anticipate what might appear, including potentially dangerous capabilities.

**What should you take away?**

That complex capabilities can arise from simple objectives applied at scale. That predicting text well enough requires modeling the world. That we can't fully predict what will emerge as models grow.

Emergence is the bridge between simple training objectives and surprising capabilities.
