# Communicating Effectively with LLMs — Metaphor Voice

*Single-threaded narrative deeply immersed in metaphorical thinking.*

Prompting is tuning a radio dial.

The signal (the model's capability) is there, broadcasting on many frequencies. Your prompt is the dial. Small adjustments shift what you receive. Turn slightly and you get static. Turn the other way and suddenly the signal comes through clear.

Different tasks live on different frequencies. Learning prompt engineering is learning where the clear signals are and how to tune to them. Practice builds intuition for the dial.

**The steering wheel**

You're not programming the model. You're steering it.

A car has its own momentum, its own capabilities. You don't control the engine directly. You turn the wheel, adjusting direction. The car goes where physics and your steering combine to take it.

The LLM has its own patterns, its own trained responses. Your prompt adjusts direction. The result is where the model's patterns and your steering combine. You suggest; the model generates.

**The mirror that needs context**

The model is a mirror that reflects what you show it.

Show it vague language, and it reflects vague language back. Show it structured, specific requests, and it reflects structure and specificity. Show it examples, and it mirrors the pattern.

The mirror doesn't know what you want. It knows what you show it. Your job is to show it enough context that the reflection matches your intent.

**The actor finding the character**

Give an actor a vague direction ("be sad") and they might produce anything. Give them rich context ("you just learned your childhood home burned down, and you're trying to hide your grief from your young child") and they channel something specific.

The model is an actor. Your prompt is the direction. More context, more specific context, produces more specific performance. "Write me a poem" versus "Write me a sonnet about aging, in the style of Shakespeare but with modern references, for my grandmother's 80th birthday" — vastly different directions, vastly different performances.

**The path through possibility space**

Every prompt opens certain paths and closes others.

"Tell me about Napoleon" opens a vast space: military history, personal life, political philosophy, mythology, his hat. The model must choose a path with little guidance.

"Tell me about Napoleon's relationship with his generals, focusing on his management style and how it evolved after 1812" narrows the paths. Fewer choices, more likely to be the path you wanted.

Prompting is laying breadcrumbs along the path you want the model to follow.

**The consultant who needs briefing**

You've hired the world's most knowledgeable consultant. But they just walked into the room. They don't know your project, your constraints, your audience, your history.

Brief them. "We're trying to improve customer retention for our SaaS product. Our users are enterprise IT managers. We've already tried email campaigns. Budget is limited."

Now the consultant can help. Without the briefing, they give generic advice. The model is the same: infinitely knowledgeable but needing your briefing to apply that knowledge to your situation.

**The iteration spiral**

Prompting rarely works perfectly the first time. It spirals inward toward what you want.

First attempt: too broad, wrong format. Second attempt: better focus, still wrong tone. Third attempt: mostly right, slight adjustments needed. Fourth: got it.

Each iteration teaches you about the model's tendencies. You learn where to add constraints, where to relax them, what examples help, what clarifications work. The spiral tightens with practice.

**The steering, not the engine**

You cannot prompt the model into capabilities it doesn't have. No magic words unlock capabilities that don't exist.

But you can steer toward capabilities that do exist and might not emerge from weaker prompts. The capability is latent; the prompt activates it. Like finding frequencies on the radio — the broadcast exists whether or not you tune to it.

Mastering prompting is mastering the dial.
